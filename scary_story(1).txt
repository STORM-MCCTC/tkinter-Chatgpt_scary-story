As the man walked his dog through the dark, deserted streets, a chill ran down his spine. The wind howled ominously, making the trees rustle in a sinister manner. Suddenly, his dog stopped dead in its tracks, growling lowly at something in the shadows.

The man peered into the darkness, his heart pounding in his chest. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of a figure lurking in the shadows. It was tall and cloaked in dark robes, its face shrouded in darkness.

Fear gripped the man as he tried to pull his dog away, but it refused to move, its eyes fixed on the figure. The cloaked figure slowly approached, its footsteps echoing eerily in the night.

With a sudden burst of courage, the man called out, "Who are you? What do you want?"

The figure stopped in its tracks, turning to face him. A cold, hollow voice whispered, "I am the harbinger of death. Your time has come."

Terrified, the man turned and ran, his dog following closely behind. He could hear the figure's chilling laughter echoing behind him as he sprinted towards safety, praying that he would escape the clutches of the mysterious figure in the night.
